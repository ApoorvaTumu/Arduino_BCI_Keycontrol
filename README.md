# Arduino_BCI_Keycontrol
Control your EEG data as a keyboard. (My EEG only has 1 electrode, but this code can be used to control more.)

The arduino code uses the brain libarary by KITSCHPATROL. Here is the link to install that.

The motive of this project was to show that you do not need a fancy 300 dollar BCI to perform simple tasks. 
Total project costs = 40 dollars USD
